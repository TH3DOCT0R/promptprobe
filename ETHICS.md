# Ethics & Scope

PromptProbe exists to **test** LLM apps for weaknesses such as **LLM01: Prompt Injection** and **LLM02: Sensitive Information Disclosure** from the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025). Use on **authorized** systems and sanitized corpora only. Do not embed real secrets or target third-party services. Reports are intended for remediation and CI gating, not public shaming.
